scenario: 
- supply system. fixed number of destinations, order unknown (depends on specific needs of each station)
- take a long enough cycle (e.g 10) so that exact computation is too expensive
- the idea is that of computing the probability of ending the cycle within a certain time, given the constraints
- we start with no constraints, and show probabilities with increasing number of constraints.

combine with OMT: e.g. probability of returning within a certain time, given that you take the best route (TSP) according to
average per-link durations (but integrate over min/max durations) consistent with existing constraints
